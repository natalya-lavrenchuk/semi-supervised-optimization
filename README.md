## Project Overview
The motivation of this project is to implement a **semi-supervised learning model** that assigns labels to unlabeled data points by minimizing a custom loss function. The loss function encourages:  
- Consistency between nearby data points  
- Agreement with known labels  

To solve this optimization problem, we apply two widely used methods:  
1. **Gradient Descent (GD)**  
2. **Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD)** with a **Gauss-Southwell (GS)** update scheme  

We then apply the same framework to the publicly available **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**, predicting whether tumors are **benign or malignant** using both GD and BCGD.

## Key Features
- Implementation of a custom semi-supervised loss function (assignment-provided)  
- Optimization via Gradient Descent and Block Coordinate Gradient Descent  
- Application to cancer classification (benign vs malignant)  
- Comparison of GD vs BCGD performance and convergence

## ðŸ”¢ Loss Function
The error is defined by two terms:  

1. The similarity of **unlabeled points** to those that are already **labeled**  
2. The similarity of **unlabeled points** to other **unlabeled points**  

The loss function is:  

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{l} \sum_{j=1}^{\mu} w_{ij}(y_j - \bar{y}_i)^2 \;+\; 
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\mu} \sum_{j=1}^{\mu} \bar{w}_{ij}(y_i - y_j)^2
\]

Where:  
- \( l \) = number of labeled points  
- \( \mu \) = number of unlabeled points  
- \( w_{ij} \) = weight between labeled \(i\) and unlabeled \(j\)  
- \( \bar{w}_{ij} \) = weight between unlabeled points \(i\) and \(j\)  

To perform optimization, we consider the derivative of the loss function:

\[
2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{l} w_{ij}(y_j - \bar{y}_i) \;+\; 
2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{\mu} \bar{w}_{ij}(y_j - y_i)
\]

## Results
- On the **synthetic dataset (loss function)**, the model achieved an **accuracy of ~70%**  
- On the **breast cancer dataset**, the model achieved an **accuracy of ~68%**  
- The model reached a **recall of ~73%** on the cancer dataset, showing strong sensitivity in detecting malignant cases  
- BCGD with Gauss-Southwell updates showed faster convergence than GD
