Description of Assignment: The motivation of this code is to implement a semi-supervised learning model that assigns labels to unlabeled data points by minimizing a given loss function. The loss function encourages consistency between nearby data points and agreement with known labels. To solve this optimization problem, we apply two widely used methods: (i) Gradient Descent (GD), and (ii) Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) with a Gauss-Southwell (GS) update scheme.
We then go on to apply the same optimization problem using a public available breast cancer data set to predict whether cancerous tumors are benign or malignant. In this section we also apply GD and BCGD algorithms.
